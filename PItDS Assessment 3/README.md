# B155243 - PItDS Assignment 3


Running the notebook:
Please make sure to install all the required packages or use the following lines in a bash shell to create a virtual environment and run the Jupyter Notebook:

virtualenv B155243
source B155243/bin/activate
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
B155243/bin/jupyter-


Libraries:
All the libraries used in the project are listed in the file requirements.txt


Datasets:
The datasets are located in the folder ./data/ in two folders named part1 and part3. You can delete the content of these two folders and run the entire notebook to test the automation of part 4. (Please do not delete the folders themselves as this was not handled in the code)
